## Flying Fish sample app

During development we're gong to create what we would like a Flying Fish app to look like. Sometimes the best way to know how to make generators is to do it by hand first.

### Milestone 1 - What do we want the skeleton to look like? 

Goals

- [ ] Create a very simple REST based backend first
  - [ ] Probably with SQLite with no ORM
- [ ] Modify the default flutter counter app to use the backend
- [ ] Celebrate

### Retro - Is this useful? What is missing to make this MVP Level

- [ ] How can we bundle this as a monorepo?
- [ ] Can we make a global "start" command for the server and client(s)
